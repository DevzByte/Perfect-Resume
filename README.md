# Following the procedure you can make your contribution with ease

```

- ## Step 4 : Create a branch

On your local machine go the project folder that you cloned and use following git command inside that folder

create a new branch using below command

```
git checkout -b
```

e.g.

git commit -m "resolved the <issue>"
```

- ## Step 7 : Push changes to GitHub

Now we have to push the changes that we made to remote repository on specified branch to do so use command below

```
git push origin <branch name>
```

Name of branch is same as you created in [Step 3](https://github.com/uday03meh/Perfect-Resume/edit/main/README.md#step-3--clone-the-repository)

- ## Step 8 : Submit your changes for review

Once you have pushed your code to GitHub, now it's time to create pull request, you will go to the repository click on compare and pull request and submit the pull request.

Soon, we will be merging all your pull requests to the main branch of project and you will also get notification once your pull request is merged with existing code base. After that you will be able to see your details in contributor section on the page below.
